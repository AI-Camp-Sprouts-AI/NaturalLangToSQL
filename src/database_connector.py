# This file has to create the database connection

"""
This file has to be used to create the connection to the database

This module should expose functions to
1. Create a Table
2. Add Rows to Database
3. Delete Rows from Database
4. Check whether the table exists
5. Run some select queries on the database


I leave the structure of this module implementation to the developer.

The database connection initialization has to be done within this module,
and that connection has to be maintained till the end of the application.
